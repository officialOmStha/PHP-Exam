In PHP, a function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.
Functions are created using the function keyword followed by a name and parentheses.
Inside the curly braces {}, you write the statements that the function should execute.
You can also pass information into a function using parameters,
and return a value using the return keyword. For example,
a function like addNumbers($a, $b) can take two numbers, add them,
and return the result. Using functions makes programs cleaner, easier to
 understand, and reduces repetition since the same function can be used
 multiple times throughout the code.
